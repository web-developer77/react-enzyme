Reagent
=======

Reagent was a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate,
and traverse your React Components' output.

It has now been renamed to [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme). Please update your projects.
